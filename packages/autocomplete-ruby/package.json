  "readme": "# Atom Autocomplete+ Ruby Suggestions\n[![Dependency status](https://david-dm.org/ianhattendorf/autocomplete-ruby.svg)](https://david-dm.org/ianhattendorf/autocomplete-ruby)\n[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/ianhattendorf%2Fautocomplete-ruby.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/gh/ianhattendorf%2Fautocomplete-ruby)\n\nProvides intelligent code completion for Ruby. Requires [RSense](https://github.com/rsense/rsense) and [Autocomplete+](https://github.com/atom-community/autocomplete-plus).\n\n## Status\nWorks for the most part, however **not on Windows**. This is due to a bug in [RSense](https://github.com/rsense/rsense), which is no longer being developed. Any bugs/issues related to rsense itself will need to be reported in that repo, and probably won't be fixed.\n\nPlease read the [Known Issues](#known-issues) before reporting any issues.\n\n## Why?\nBecause I wanted Ruby code completion in Atom and [atom-rsense](https://github.com/rsense/atom-rsense) is broken and hasn't been updated since June 2014.\n\n## Installation\nMake sure you have Java installed on your machine.\n\nInstall rsense:\n```shell\n$ gem install rsense\n```\n\nIf you get an error about not being able to find `rsense` after opening a ruby file, you will need to set the path to the rsense binary in the plugin settings. The path is different depending on which OS/Ruby environment manager you are using. Executing `which rsense` or `gem environment` might help you locate it.\n\n## Usage\nJust type some stuff, and autocomplete+ will automatically show you some suggestions.\n\nNote: If you use Winows, it might take about 10 seconds after the first suggestions pop up before rsense will give you any suggestions.\n\n## Known Issues\n- Sometimes the environment isn't configured correctly when launching Atom from it's launcher (any custom config in `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, etc.). If you have any issues with the plugin, please try launching atom from the terminal first: `$ atom`.\n- RSense doesn't appear to work on Windows.\n\nFeel free to report any other issues you encounter.\n\n## Development\nClone the repository into your working directory:\n```shell\n$ git clone git@github.com:ianhattendorf/autocomplete-ruby.git\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n```shell\n$ cd autocomplete-ruby\n$ apm install\n```\n\nLink to Atom as a dev package:\n```shell\n$ apm link --dev\n```\n\nFeel free to fork it and submit a pull request for any changes you make.\n",
